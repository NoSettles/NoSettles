              <p>One of the most popular ways for School Fundraising is making running events in which they're able to gather money from people. Another way that is also very popular is to make small sales in which the profit goes to school. However, fundraising online is not yet so popular, but it works much better and it can access more people at the same time. Many schools focus on small sales in which the profit is very low, but yet they have not considered online fundraising, which is <strong>much more efficient in time and costs</strong>.</p>
